The table shows the executed commands recognized from the voice and every single cell displays the command name and the passed parameters.


In the bottom area you can see three differents parts: 
- current command text: here you can visualize the recognized command
- text speech text: here you can see what the recognize system understands from your voice
- listen button and clean button: the listen button starts the listening of your voice and clean button interrupts it.

In the header there are two main buttons: 
-  commands: brings you to a page in which you can visualize all the active/registered commands
-  language: brings you to a list of available language to change the application language (this language changes also the speech recognition system: the commands will have a different command key)
